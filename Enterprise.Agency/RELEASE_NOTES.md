Introducing our new Concurrency Model Package! ðŸš€

Purpose: This package simplifies concurrent programming by providing robust abstractions for managing parallel execution.
Key Features:
Agents: Easily configure and manage concurrent actors (agents) with their own contract interfaces.
Stateful Entities: Agents maintain state and process CRUD operations based on incoming messages.
Sequential Message Handling: No need for locking mechanisms; messages are processed sequentially.

Upgrade your concurrency game with our powerful package! Get started today. ðŸŒŸ
