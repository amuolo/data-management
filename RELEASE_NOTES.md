Key Features:
Agents: Easily configure and manage concurrent actors (agents) with their own contract interfaces.
Stateful Entities: Agents maintain state and process CRUD operations based on incoming messages.
Sequential Message Handling: No need for locking mechanisms; messages are processed sequentially.
